# Drupal 7 Deconstructed

*A plain(ish) English description of how the big pieces of Drupal 7 do what they do.*

If you've ever wondered how Drupal works, then this is for you.

It should be readable without having the actual core code in front of you, but feel
free to reference the actual code for anything that you'd like as you go. I've tried
to include API links to any functions or classes that I talk about, so click away!
